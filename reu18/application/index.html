	Welcome! <br><br>

	The 2018 UC Berkeley Geometry and Topology RTG Summer Research Program for Undergraduates is an intensive 8 week program for up to 12 undergraduates to explore cutting edge mathematics and work on related research projects.  Students will attend lectures and problem sessions, work on research problems, give presentations about their work, and write research reports.  Participants will join one of two research groups. <br><br>

	The dates of the program will be <u><b>June 18th - August 10th</b></u>.  In their free time, students will have the opportunity to explore Berkeley, San Francisco, and the wonderful Bay Area.  There will also be social activities organized by the research group leaders and regular colloquia.  Participants will have their choice of either a $3000 stipend or a $1000 stipend plus room and board; a stipend for travel is also available. <br><br>

	The program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation RTG (Research Training Group) in Geometry and Topology at UC Berkeley, and only US citizens and permanent residents may apply.  For more information, see the FAQ page above.  Please do not hesitate to contact the program directors with any questions.
