<b> Group 1: Symplectic Capacities Of Toric Domains </b> <br>
Project Leader: Julian Chaidez <br><br>

Symplectic geometry is the study of the topology and geometry of classical mechanical systems and various generalizations. It is a vibrant field of mathematics that has many connections to other kinds of geometry and physics. The central objects of study are symplectic manifolds and contact manifolds, which are generalizations of phase space and (certain) constant energy hypersurfaces in phase space, respectively. One interesting set of questions about symplectic manifolds that one can ask is: when does a symplectic manifold X arise as an open subset of another symplectic manifold Y? One type of tool for answering this question to the negative is a symplectic capacity c. These are numbers c(X) associated to any symplectic manifold X such that if X is a subset of Y then c(X) < c(Y). <br><br>

This research program will focus on certain capacities recently defined in a paper by Gutt and Hutchings in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06514"> [1]</a>. While the technical details involved in this definition are beyond the scope of this program, the capacities satisfy simple axioms and can be computed in an explicit, combinatorial way for certain nice open subsets of Euclidean space. We will be interested in computing these capacities by hand in some interesting cases, understanding the dynamical structure of the open subsets involved, writing programs to compute these capacities and generalizing the combinatorial formulas in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06514"> [1]</a> to more general open subsets of Euclidean space.<br><br>

Prerequisites: Students should be familiar with point set topology (at the level of Rudin's real analysis) and vector calculus (preferably in dimensions higher than 3). Some basic background in differential topology or differential geometry would be helpful. Programming skills may be useful. Basic symplectic geometry and an axiomatic viewpoint on capacities will be covered at the start of the program.<br><br>

<b> Group 2: Fundamental Domains of Hyperbolic 3-manifolds </b> <br>
Project Leader: Franco Vargas Pallete <br><br>

Hyperbolic geometry plays an important role in understanding 3-dimensional geometry and topology, largely due to Thurston's geometrization conjecture (proved by Perelman). This conjecture states that any closed 3-manifold can be canonically decomposed into pieces, each of which possesses one of eight geometric structures (hyperbolic among them). We can try to understand hyperbolic manifolds by asking ourselves how do they look like, in which case is natural to aspire for precise descriptions of certain fundamental domains.<br><br>

This research program will focus on Ford fundamental domains, following an article by Jorgensen in <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2044551">[2]</a> and subsequent work by Hirotaka Akiyoshi, Makoto Sakuma, Masaaki Wada, Yasushi Yamashita and Mikio Furokawa. After understanding Jorgensen's description for the once-punctured torus, we will be interested in computer visualization, generalizations to another manifolds and/or descriptions under geometric limits. We will be also interested in further understanding of general hyperbolic convex polyhedron.<br><br>

Prerequisites: Students should be familiar with point-set topology and real analysis. Some basic background in differential topology or differential geometry would be helpful. Programming skills may be useful. Basic Kleinian group theory (a.k.a. the study of Kleinian models of hyperbolic manifolds) will be covered at the start of the program.<br><br>
